While perplexity quantifies the most comprehensible prediction performance, it does not provide qualitative information on the success or failure of models. Another approach for evaluating language models is thus proposed, using the scaling properties of natural language. Five such tests are considered, with the first two accounting for the vocabulary population and the other three for the long memory of natural language. The following models were evaluated with these tests: n-grams, probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), Simon and Pitman-Yor (PY) processes, hierarchical PY, and neural language models. Only the neural language models exhibit the long memory properties of natural language, but to a limited degree. The effectiveness of every test of these models is also discussed.\n",

The first contribution of this paper focuses on the characterization of the tails of the so-called Pitman--Yor process, which includes the Dirichlet process as a particular case. We show that the right tail of a Pitman--Yor process, known as the stable law process, is heavy-tailed, provided that the centering distribution is itself heavy-tailed. A second contribution of the paper rests on the development of two classes of heavy-tailed mixture models and the assessment of their relative merits. Multivariate extensions of the proposed heavy-tailed mixtures are here devised along with a predictor-dependent version so to learn about the effect of covariates on a multivariate heavy-tailed response. The simulation study suggests that the proposed method performs well in a variety of scenarios, and we showcase the application of the proposed methods in a neuroscience dataset.\n",

The process is indexed by a type parameter $\\sigma$, which controls the number of different species in a finite sample from a realization of the distribution. A random sample of size $n$ from the Pitman-Yor process of type $\\sigma>0$ will contain of the order $n^\\sigma$ distinct values (``species''). In this paper we consider the estimation of the type parameter by both empirical Bayes and full Bayes methods. We derive the asymptotic normality of the empirical Bayes estimator and a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the full Bayes posterior, in the frequentist setup that the observations are a random sample from a given true distribution. We also consider the estimation of the second parameter of the Pitman-Yor process, the prior precision.

In order to facilitate the application to various tasks, we propose the joint space model of ngram-HMM language model. We show an experiment of system combination in the area of SMT. One discovery was that our treatment of noise improved the results 0.20 BLEU points if NPLM is trained in relatively small corpus, in our case 500,000 sentence pairs, which is often the case due to the long training time of NPLM.\n",

The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline.

The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary.\n",

      "Text: Language models have primarily been evaluated with perplexity. While perplexity quantifies the most comprehensible prediction performance, it does not provide qualitative information on the success or failure of models. Another approach for evaluating language models is thus proposed, using the scaling properties of natural language. Five such tests are considered, with the first two accounting for the vocabulary population and the other three for the long memory of natural language. The following models were evaluated with these tests: n-grams, probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), Simon and Pitman-Yor (PY) processes, hierarchical PY, and neural language models. Only the neural language models exhibit the long memory properties of natural language, but to a limited degree. The effectiveness of every test of these models is also discussed.\n",

      "citation_id: 3\n",
      "Text: Heavy tails are often found in practice, and yet they are an Achilles heel of a variety of mainstream random probability measures such as the Dirichlet process. The first contribution of this paper focuses on the characterization of the tails of the so-called Pitman--Yor process, which includes the Dirichlet process as a particular case. We show that the right tail of a Pitman--Yor process, known as the stable law process, is heavy-tailed, provided that the centering distribution is itself heavy-tailed. A second contribution of the paper rests on the development of two classes of heavy-tailed mixture models and the assessment of their relative merits. Multivariate extensions of the proposed heavy-tailed mixtures are here devised along with a predictor-dependent version so to learn about the effect of covariates on a multivariate heavy-tailed response. The simulation study suggests that the proposed method performs well in a variety of scenarios, and we showcase the application of the proposed methods in a neuroscience dataset.\n",

      "citation_id: 4\n",
      "Text: The Pitman-Yor process is a random discrete probability distribution of which the atoms can be used to model the relative abundance of species. The process is indexed by a type parameter $\\sigma$, which controls the number of different species in a finite sample from a realization of the distribution. A random sample of size $n$ from the Pitman-Yor process of type $\\sigma>0$ will contain of the order $n^\\sigma$ distinct values (``species''). In this paper we consider the estimation of the type parameter by both empirical Bayes and full Bayes methods. We derive the asymptotic normality of the empirical Bayes estimator and a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the full Bayes posterior, in the frequentist setup that the observations are a random sample from a given true distribution. We also consider the estimation of the second parameter of the Pitman-Yor process, the prior precision. We apply our results to derive the limit behaviour of the likelihood ratio in a setting of forensic statistics.\n",

The KPYP is constructed by first introducing an infinite sequence of random locations. Then, based on the stick-breaking construction of the Pitman-Yor process, we define a predictor-dependent random probability measure by considering that the discount hyperparameters of the Beta-distributed random weights (stick variables) of the process are not uniform among the weights, but controlled by a kernel function expressing the proximity between the location assigned to each weight and the given predictors.\n",

      "Text: A neural probabilistic language model (NPLM) provides an idea to achieve the better perplexity than n-gram language model and their smoothed language models. This paper investigates application area in bilingual NLP, specifically Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We focus on the perspectives that NPLM has potential to open the possibility to complement potentially `huge' monolingual resources into the `resource-constraint' bilingual resources. We introduce an ngram-HMM language model as NPLM using the non-parametric Bayesian construction. In order to facilitate the application to various tasks, we propose the joint space model of ngram-HMM language model. We show an experiment of system combination in the area of SMT. One discovery was that our treatment of noise improved the results 0.20 BLEU points if NPLM is trained in relatively small corpus, in our case 500,000 sentence pairs, which is often the case due to the long training time of NPLM.\n",

      "Text: We propose a simple, scalable, fully generative model for transition-based dependency parsing with high accuracy. The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.\n",

      "Text: We introduce the Pitman Yor Diffusion Tree (PYDT) for hierarchical clustering, a generalization of the Dirichlet Diffusion Tree (Neal, 2001) which removes the restriction to binary branching structure. The generative process is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points. We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm. Both algorithms use message passing on the tree structure. The utility of the model and algorithms is demonstrated on synthetic and real world data, both continuous and binary.\n",

The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.\n",

The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.\n",

We prove some theoretical properties of the model and then present two inference methods: a collapsed MCMC sampler which allows us to model uncertainty over tree structures, and a computationally efficient greedy Bayesian EM search algorithm.

While perplexity quantifies the most comprehensible prediction performance, it does not provide qualitative information on the success or failure of models. Another approach for evaluating language models is thus proposed, using the scaling properties of natural language. Five such tests are considered, with the first two accounting for the vocabulary population and the other three for the long memory of natural language. The following models were evaluated with these tests: n-grams, probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG), Simon and Pitman-Yor (PY) processes, hierarchical PY, and neural language models. Only the neural language models exhibit the long memory properties of natural language, but to a limited degree. The effectiveness of every test of these models is also discussed.\n",

The first contribution of this paper focuses on the characterization of the tails of the so-called Pitman--Yor process, which includes the Dirichlet process as a particular case. We show that the right tail of a Pitman--Yor process, known as the stable law process, is heavy-tailed, provided that the centering distribution is itself heavy-tailed. A second contribution of the paper rests on the development of two classes of heavy-tailed mixture models and the assessment of their relative merits. Multivariate extensions of the proposed heavy-tailed mixtures are here devised along with a predictor-dependent version so to learn about the effect of covariates on a multivariate heavy-tailed response. The simulation study suggests that the proposed method performs well in a variety of scenarios, and we showcase the application of the proposed methods in a neuroscience dataset.\n",

      "Text: The Pitman-Yor process is a random discrete probability distribution of which the atoms can be used to model the relative abundance of species. The process is indexed by a type parameter $\\sigma$, which controls the number of different species in a finite sample from a realization of the distribution. A random sample of size $n$ from the Pitman-Yor process of type $\\sigma>0$ will contain of the order $n^\\sigma$ distinct values (``species''). In this paper we consider the estimation of the type parameter by both empirical Bayes and full Bayes methods. We derive the asymptotic normality of the empirical Bayes estimator and a Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the full Bayes posterior, in the frequentist setup that the observations are a random sample from a given true distribution. We also consider the estimation of the second parameter of the Pitman-Yor process, the prior precision. We apply our results to derive the limit behaviour of the likelihood ratio in a setting of forensic statistics.\n",

This paper investigates application area in bilingual NLP, specifically Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We focus on the perspectives that NPLM has potential to open the possibility to complement potentially `huge' monolingual resources into the `resource-constraint' bilingual resources. We introduce an ngram-HMM language model as NPLM using the non-parametric Bayesian construction. In order to facilitate the application to various tasks, we propose the joint space model of ngram-HMM language model. We show an experiment of system combination in the area of SMT. One discovery was that our treatment of noise improved the results 0.20 BLEU points if NPLM is trained in relatively small corpus, in our case 500,000 sentence pairs, which is often the case due to the long training time of NPLM.\n",

The generative process of the PYDT is described and shown to result in an exchangeable distribution over data points.

       "The Pitman-Yor Language Model has potential future developments in nonparametric clustering of data and generative transition-based dependency parsing. The kernel Pitman-Yor process (KPYP) has been proposed for nonparametric clustering of data with general spatial or temporal interdependencies. The KPYP is constructed by introducing an infinite sequence of random locations and defining a predictor-dependent random probability measure based on the stick-breaking construction of the Pitman-Yor process. The discount hyperparameters of the Beta-distributed random weights of the process are controlled by a kernel function expressing the proximity between the location assigned to each weight and the given predictors [^5][^6].\n",
       "\n",
       "Moreover, a generative model for transition-based dependency parsing has been proposed, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes (HPYPs). The model learns a distribution over derivations of parser transitions, words, and POS tags. To enable efficient inference, a novel algorithm for linear-time decoding in a generative transition-based parser has been proposed based on particle filtering, a method for sequential Monte Carlo sampling. This method enables the beam-size during decoding to depend on the uncertainty of the model. The model has high accuracy and obtains better perplexity than an n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. The model is also able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation [^8][^9].\n",

       "\n",
       "This systematic review provides an overview of the Pitman-Yor Language Model, its historical background, and potential future developments. The Pitman Yor Diffusion Tree (PYDT) was introduced as a generalization of the Dirichlet Diffusion Tree for hierarchical clustering [^1]. The model has shown promising results in nonparametric clustering of data [^5][^6] and generative transition-based dependency parsing [^8]. The Pitman-Yor process has also been characterized for its heavy-tailed mixture models [^3] and estimation of its type parameter by empirical and full Bayes methods [^4]. While the model has been evaluated with perplexity, other approaches have been proposed to evaluate the success or failure of the model [^2]. Overall, the Pitman-Yor Language Model has shown potential in various applications and can be further developed to improve its performance in natural language processing tasks.\n",
